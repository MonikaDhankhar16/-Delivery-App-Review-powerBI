# Power BI Builds 4 - Delivery App Review
THE BRIEF

You are working at a consultancy that implemented an app for a client to help them improve their delivery process and fulfilment from warehouses to store.

The app was the created so that drivers could scan the label as opposed to entering it manually while also recording the time of arrival, the time they left the store and some other variables that the management were interested in improving.

The management is now looking to evaluate how the business has reacted and how effective the app is.

The senior consultant has extracted all data from the app and placed it into the file as below.

He now wants you to use this data and create a report or dashboard to help management visualise what is happening so that we can decide what the next stage of the transformation is.

The management are particularly interested in any warehouse store combination that itâ€™s not working well for.

The time being spent at a store.

The number of times manual entry was still used.

The number of damaged labels

If returns are being collected

A 1 in the data represents true

A 0 represents false
Match Method is either- Manual or scanned. If the app was used correctly then they would have scanned.

Label damage-One of the main reasons match methods are manual is because there is normally damage to the label for scanning however this is not always the case we can sometimes have a damaged label that we still managed to scan and even a perfect label that they still used manual entry.

Damage- represents if there was any damage to the actual parcels being delivered.

Returns Collected- Stores are allowed to send customer returns, old stock etc and this field indicates if the store did or not.


## The key metrics were:

The no of manual scans

The no of damaged labels

The time spent store
